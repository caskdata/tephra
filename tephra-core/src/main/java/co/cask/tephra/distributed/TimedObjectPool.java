/**
 * A TimedObjectPool is an object pool that can dynamically shrink and grow.
 * Objects in the pool will be destroyed and discarded based upon a configured
 * timeout. For instance, if the time out is one minute, and an object hasn't
 * been used for two minutes, then the object will be cleaned up the next time
 * that the cleanup happens.
 *
 * Normally, an element is obtained by a client and then returned to the pool
 * after use. However, if the element gets into a bad state, the client can
 * also discard the element. This will cause the element to be removed from
 * the pool, and for a subsequent request, a new element can be created
 * on the fly to replace the discarded one.
 *
 * The pool starts with zero (active) elements. Every time a client attempts
 * to obtain an element, an element from the pool is returned if available.
 * Otherwise, a new element is created (using abstract method create(), this
 * must be overridden by all implementations), and the number of active elements
 * is increased by one.
 *
 * Every time an element is discarded, it is "destroyed" in order to properly
 * release all of its resources before discarding. Every time an element is
 * returned to the pool, it is "recycled" to restore its fresh state for the
 * next use.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the elements
 * @param <E> the type of exception thrown by create()
